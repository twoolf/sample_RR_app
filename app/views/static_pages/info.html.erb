<h1>Background Information</h1>
  There is a tremendous amount of information available on the web.  This ranges in quality and in insight.  Ultimately we all have to make difficult decisions about what to eat and in what quantity. Our goal is to help you understand your sugar and carbohydrate intakes and to make your own decisions about how much you should take in daily.  For us the motivations came from several books and movies.  Please feel free to add your own comments and suggested links to this background information as you become engaged with tracking your sugar and carbohydate levels.
<h2>Pollen's books</h2>
<p>
 Michael Pollan started a new trend towards food awareness and food choices through a series of books. He has sparked many insightful discussions both by his writing and through his insights. Two beginning points are books from 2007 and 2009.  The first outlined the dilemma that we all face in making intelligent food choices: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omnivores-Dilemma-Natural-History-Meals/dp/0143038583/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411215981&sr=1-4&keywords=michael+pollan">The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Nature History of Four Meals</a>.  The second provided a manifesto for his version of healthy eating: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411215981&sr=1-3&keywords=michael+pollan"> In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto</a>.

<h2> Vegetarianism, Paleo Diets, Atkins Diets </h2>
 Further difficulties await all of us as we struggle with what to eat and how much.  The excellent book that T. Colin Campbell wrote provides a strong case for a largely plant based diet: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Implications/dp/1932100660/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411216380&sr=1-1&keywords=china+study">The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health</a>.  Recently a lot of attention has been focused on variations of Paleo diets.  These can be either largely meat based or largely vegatarian.  Robert Lustig has pointed out that it may be best to be either more Atkins like (meat) or more China Study like if you go Paleo.  One of the most popular suggestions for diet based on Paleo is the book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Paleo-Customized-Whole-Foods-Lifestyle/dp/1936608758/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411216573&sr=1-4&keywords=paleo+diet">Practical Paleo: A Customized Approach to Health and a Whole-Foods Lifestyle</a>.  There has been much written (both strongly positive and strongly negative) about the meat-based approaches to diet. The Atkins diet, or variations on it, seems to be the path most have referred to for this choice: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Atkins-New-Diet-Revolution/dp/006001203X/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411216870&sr=1-7&keywords=atkins+diet">Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution</a>.  Our approach with this website is to enable you to track your sugar, carbohydrates and total calories. We are not advocating any one particular choice of diet or of food types with this website.

<h2>Taubes' books</h2>
<p>
  The central thesis of the two books that Taubes has written is that our growing obesity problem is ultimately a problem of too many carbohydrates being eaten over each day.  He believes that this can be tied to growing amounts of sugar intake along with processed food.  A major problem is that commercially available low-fat foods have compensated for their low-fat with high sugar and carbohydrate.  While not providing diet guidance, the general premise is that eating the low carbohydrate way is likely to improve your weight and to decrease your odds of metabolic diseases (e.g. diabetes).

  Read one of the books that Taubes has written 
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About/dp/0307474259/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1410610720&sr=1-1&keywords=why+do+we+get+fat">Why We get Fat</a> or

<h2> Lustig books and video</h2>
  Lustig has become the champion of a campaign to limit sugar intake (<a href="http://www.oprah.com/health/Health-Risks-of-Sugar-Robert-Lustig-Interview_1">Oprah Interview</a>).  His youtube video 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM">Sugar: The Bitter Truth</a> 
brought with it a new awareness of the potential dangers of high fructose corn syrup.  His recent book 
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fat-Chance-Beating-Against-Processed/dp/0142180432/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411215078&sr=1-1&keywords=lustig">Fat Chance: Beating the Odds Against Sugar, Processed Food, Obesity, and Disease</a>.
contains more information beyond the youtube video.  In addition there was a recent movie that is largely based on his ideas that brings even more awareness to the potential dangers of high sugar intake (<a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2014/09/fed-%E2%80%93-what-food-industry-doesn%E2%80%99t-want-us-know">Fed Up</a>).
